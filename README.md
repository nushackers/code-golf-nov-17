# Friday Hacks 145: Code Golf (Nov 17)

## Rules
1. You may use any language.
2. Each submission is expected to be a complete program that reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
3. Your output has to match the expected output exactly, with the exception of trailing whitespaces.
4. Programs may terminate with error, as long as error messages are not written to standard output.

## Testing your submissions

Your program will read the test cases from standard input and print directly to standard output.
Sample test cases can be found in each problem's folder.
To verify your output, you may diff it against the sample output.

E.g. `diff <(python test.py < 1.in) 1.out`

Note that for problems 1 and 3, your program is expected to process the test cases in every line, one by one.
